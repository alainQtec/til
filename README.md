# 📝 Today I Learned
A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post. Stuff like code snippets. First Inspired by [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til), which I spotted on His [post](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/).
